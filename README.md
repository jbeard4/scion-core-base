# Overview

This module provides an abstract class BaseInterpreter, which can be extended
to provide interpreters that implement custom Statecharts semantics. 

Currently, BaseInterpreter is extended into two concrete Statechart realizations,
[scion-core](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION-CORE) and 
[scion-core-legacy](https://github.com/jbeard4/scion-core-legacy).
